# What's software
Software is a set of items or objects that form a "configuration" that includes
- computer programs(Instructions)
- data structures - enable the programs to adequately manipulate information
- documentation

# What's a good software
### Three ways of considering quality
- The quality of the product 
	user's external view and developer's internal view

- The quality of the process
	the development process needs to be modeled
	CMM(SEI's Capability Maturity Model)
- The quality of the product in the context of the business environment

# Software characteristics

# Software categories
- system software: service other programs
- application software
- engineering/scientific software
- embedded software
- product-line software
- web-applications
- ai software
- ubiquitous computing
- netsourcing
- open source
	......

# Software evolution

# Software crisis
- Projects running over-budget.
- Projects running over-time.
- Software was very inefficient.
- Software was of low quality.
- Software often did not meet requirements.
- Projects were unmanageable and code difficult to maintain. (difficult to modify, add new function, reuse)
- Software was never delivered.

### reasons
- rolling baseline
- software complexity
- failure to manage risk

# What's SE
SE is an **engineering discipline** that is concerned with all aspects of software production from the early stages of **system specification through to maintaining** the system after it has gone into use.

# Software Myths
### management myths
If we get behind schedule, we can add more programmers and catch up.

### customer myths
Project requirements continually change, but change can be easily accommodated because software is flexible.
