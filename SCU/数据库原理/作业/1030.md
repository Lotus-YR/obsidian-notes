I. Design a database for an automobile company to provide to its dealers to assist them in maintaining customer records and dealer inventory and to assist sales staff in ordering cars.

   Each vehicle is identified by a vehicle identification number(VIN). Each individual vehicle is a particular model of a particular brand offered by the company (e.g., the FX is a model of the car brand Jaguar of Tata Motors). Each model can be offered with a variety of options, but an individual car may have only some (or none) of the available options. The database needs to store information about **models**, **brands**, and **options**, as well as information about individual **dealers**, **customers**, and **cars**.

  Your design should include an E-R diagram, a set of relation schemas, and a list of constraints, including primary-key and foreign-key constraints.



II.   请为某医院设计数据库系统，需要管理以下信息：该医院下设若干科室（科室号，科室名），每个科室有若干医生（职工号，姓名，性别，职称）和护士（职工号，姓名，性别），每位医生和护士都只在一个科室工作。病人（身份证号，姓名，性别，出生日期）在科室住院，一位病人可能多次在同一科室住院，因此需要记录每次住院的入院日期和出院日期。

1.请分析上述描述，并充分利用常识，画出该系统的ER图；

2.将你设计的ER图转化为一组合适的关系模式，需给出主码、外码约束。
