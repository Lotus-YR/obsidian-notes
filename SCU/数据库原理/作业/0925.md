1. Write the following inserts, deletes or updates in SQL, using the university schema.
	 a. Increase the salary of each instructor in the Comp. Sci. department by 10%.
	```sql
	update instructor
	set salary = salary * 1.1
	where dept_name = "Comp. Sci.";
	```
	
    b. Delete all courses that have never been offered (that is, do not occur in the section relation).
	```sql
	delete from course
	where course_id in ( select course_id
	from course
	except
	select course_id from section);
	```

	 c. Insert every student whose tot_cred attribute is greater than 100 as an instructor in the same department, with a salary of $10,000.
	```sql
	insert into instructor(id, name, dept_name, salary)
	select id, name, dept_name, 10000
	from student
	where tot_cred > 100;
	```
	通过命令：
	SELECT pg_get_constraintdef(oid)
	FROM pg_constraint
	WHERE conname = 'instructor_salary_check';
	可知原数据库中工资有最小金额的限制，设置10000不成功
	
	d. create a new course "CS-001", titled with "Weekly Seminar", with 0 credits.
	```sql
	insert into course
	values('CS-001', 'Weekly Seminar', 'Comp. Sci.', 5);
	```

	e. Create a section of this course in Fall 2009, with sec_id of 1.
	```sql
	insert into section(course_id, sec_id, semester, year, building, room_number, time_slot_id)
	select course_id, 1, 'Fall', 2009, NULL, NULL, NULL
	from course
	where course_id = 'CS-001';	
	```

	 f. Enroll every student in the Comp. Sci. department in the above section.
	```sql
	insert into takes(id, course_id, sec_id, semester, year, grade)
	select id, 'CS-001', 1, 'Fall', 2009, NULL
	from student
	where dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.';
	```

	g. Delete enrollments in the above section where the student's name is Chavez.
	```sql
	delete from takes
	where id = (select id
	                 from student
	                 where name = 'Chavez');
	```

	h. Delete the course CS-101. What will happen if you run this delete statement without first deleting offerings (sections) of this course.
	```delete from course where course_id = 'CS-101';```
	描述:  Key (course_id)=(CS-101) is still referenced from table "prereq".

	i. Delete all takes tuples corresponding to any section of any course with the word "database" as a part of the title; ignore case when matching the word with the title.
	```sql
	delete from course
	where title ilike '%database%';
	```
	

2. Consider the following employee database：
  employee(employee_name, street, city)
  works(employee_name, company_name, salary)
  company(company_name, city)
  manages(employee_name, manager_name)
   Give an expression in SQL for each of the following queries.
 a. Find the names and cities of residence of all employees who work for "First Bank Corporation".
```sql
select employee.employee_name as name, city
from employee
join works on works.employee_name = employee.employee_name
where company_name = 'First Bank Corporation';
```
b. Find the names, street addresses, and cities of residence of all employee who works for "First Bank Corporation" and earn more than $10,000.
```sql
select employee.employee_name as name, street, city
from employee
join works on works.employee_name = employee.employee_name
where company_name = 'First Bank Corporation' and salary > 10000;
```
 c. Find all employees in the database who do not work for "First Bank Corporation".
```sql
select  employee.employee_name, works.company_name
from employee
join works on works.employee_name = employee.employee_name
where company_name <> 'First Bank Corporation';
```
 d. Find all employees in the database who earn more than each employee of "Small Bank Corporation".
 ```sql
select
from employee
join works on employee.employee_name = works.employee_name
where works.salary > (select max(salary)
                              from works
                              where company_name = 'Small Bank Corporation');
 ```

 e. Assume that the companies may be located in several cities. Find all companies located in every city in which "Small Bank Corporation" is located.
 ```sql
select
from company
where city = ( select city
                    from company
                    where company_name = 'Small Bank Corporation');
 ```

 f. Find the company that has the most employees.
 ```sql
select company_name, count( * )
from works
group by company_name
having count( * ) = (select max(num_employee)
                         from (select company_name, count( * ) as num_employee
                                from works
                                group by company_name) as employee_count);
 ```

 g. Find those companies whose employees earn a higher salary, on average, than the average salary at "First Bank Corporation".
 ```sql
select company_name, avg(salary)
from works
group by company_name
having avg(salary) > (select avg(salary)
                            from works
                            group by company_name
                            having company_name = 'First Bank Corporation');
```
