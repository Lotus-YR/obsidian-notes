I. Write the following queries in realtioal algebra, using the university schema.
  1. Find the names of all students who have taken at least one Comp.Sci. course.
```sql
	select distinct student.id, course.dept_name
	from student
	join takes on student.id = takes.id
	join course on takes.course_id = course.course_id
	where course.dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.'
```

  2. Find the IDs and names of all students who have not taken any course offering before Spring 2009.
```sql
select student.id, student.name, takes.course_id, takes.semester, takes.year
	from student
	join takes on student.id = takes.id
	where not takes.course_id in ( select course_id
						    from takes
					        where year < 2009 );
```
							
  3. For each department, find the maximum salary of instructors in that department. You may assume that every department has at least one instructor.
	select dept_name, max(salary) as max_salary
	from instructor
	group by dept_name;

  4. Find the lowest, across all departments, of the per-department maximum salary computed by the prededing query.I.
	select min(max_query.max_salary) as lowest_maximun_salary
	from (select dept_name, max(salary) as max_salary
		from instructor
		group by dept_name) as max_query;


II. Consider the following relational chema for a library:
       member(member_no, name, dob)
       books(isbn, title, authors, publisher)
       borrowed(member_no, isbn, date)
  Write the following queries in ralational algebra.
  1. Find the names of members who have borrowed any book published by "McGraw-Hill".
	select distinct member.name
	from member
	join borrowed on borrowed.member = member.member_no
	join books on borrowed.isbn = books.isbn
	where publisher = 'McGraw-Hill';

  2. Find the names of members who have borrowed all books published by "McGraw-Hill".
	select member.name
	from member
	join borrowed on borrowed.member = member.member_no
	join books on borrowed.isbn = books.isbn
	where not exits
	((select books.isbn
	  from books
	  where books.publisher = 'McGraw-Hill')
	 except
	 (select books.isbn
	  from borrowed
	  where member.member_no = borrowed.member_no));

  3. Find the name and membership number of members who have borrowed more than five different books published by "McGraw-Hill".
	select member.name, member.member_no
	from member
	join borrowed on borrowed.member = member.member_no
	join books on borrowed.isbn = books.isbn
	where books.publisher = 'McGraw-Hill'
	group by member.name, member.member_no
	having count(distinct books.isbn) > 5;
	

III.设某软件公司管理系统有以下三个关系模式： 
R(Rno, Rname, Rage, Rsex, Rlevel) 说明：人员（编号，名字，年龄，性别，级别），主码为Rno
X(Xno, Xname, Xloc,Rno) 说明：项目（项目号，名称，地点，负责人编号），主码为Xno
C(Rno, Xno, pay) 说明：参与（编号，项目号，报酬），主码为（Rno，Xno）
用关系代数完成如下查询： 
1.查找超过40岁的人员的编号和姓名。 
select Rno, Rname
from R
where Rage > 40;

2.求在单个项目中获得报酬超过2000的男性人员的编号和姓名。 
select Rno, Rname
from R
join X on R.Rno = X.Rno
join C on X.Xno = C.Xno
where R.Rsex = '男' and C.pay > 2000;

3.查询参与了8号人员参与的所有项目的人员的编号、名字、级别。 
select R.Rno, R.Rname, R.Rlevel
from R
join X on R.Rno = X.Rno
where not exists
(( select Xno
  from X
  where Rno = 8)
 except
 (select Xno
 from X
 where X.Rno = R.Rno));

用SQL语言完成如下操作： 
4.查询名称中含有"手机"两个字的项目的项目号和所在地点。 
select Xno, Xloc
from X
where Xname like '%手机%';

5.查询所在地点为"成都"的项目的主管的姓名、年龄、性别。 
select R.Rname, R.Rage, R.Rsex
from X
join R on X.Rno = R.Rno
where X.Xloc = '成都';

6.查询参与了8号人员参与的所有项目的人员的编号、名字、级别。 
select R.Rno, R.Rname, R.Rlevel
from R
join X on R.Rno = X.Rno
where not exists
(( select Xno
  from X
  where Rno = 8)
 except
 (select Xno
 from X
 where X.Rno = R.Rno));

7.查询同时参与了9号和12号项目的员工的编号和姓名。 
select Rno, Rname
from R
where Rno in
((select X.Rno
  from X
  where Xno = 9)
 intersect
 (select X.Rno
 from X
where Xno = 12));

8.参与11号项目的人员每人报酬增加100元。 
update C
set pay = pay + 100
where Xno = 11;
