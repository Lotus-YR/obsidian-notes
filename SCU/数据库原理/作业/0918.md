I. Write the following queries in SQL,using the university schema. (Execute script files create_schema.sql and insert_data.sql.)
1. Find the titles of courses in the Comp.Sci. department that have 3 credits.
	where子句条件筛选
```sql
select title 
from course 
where course.dept_name = 'Comp. Sci.' and course.credits =3;
```

2. Find the IDs of all students who were taught by an instructor whose name is Einstein; make sure there are **no duplicates** in the result.
	联结
```sql
select distinct_s_id as student_id 
from instructor, advisor 
where instructor.name = 'Einstein' and i_id = instructor.id ;
```

3. Find the highest salary of any instructor.
	函数
```sql
select max(salary) as highest_salary 
from instructor;
```

4. Find all instructors earning the highest salary (there may be more than one with the same salary).
	函数+子查询
```sql
select name, salary
from instructor
where salary = (select max(salary) from instructor);
```


5. Find the enrollment（选课人数） of each section that was offered in Fall 2017.
```sql
select course_id, count(id) as enrollment
from takes
where year = 2017 and semester = 'Fall'
group by course_id;
```

6. Find the maximum enrollment, across all sections, in Fall 2017.
```sql
select max(enrollment) as max_enrollment
from (
	select course_id, count(id) as enrollment
	from takes
	where year = 2017 and semester = 'Fall'
	group by course_id
) as course_enrollment;
```

7. Find the sections that had the maximum enrollment in Fall 2017.
```sql
select course_id
from takes
where year = 2017 and semester = 'Fall'
group by course_id
having count(id) = (select max(enrollment) as max_enrollment
					from (
						select course_id, count(id) as enrollment
						from takes
						where year = 2017 and semester = 'Fall'
						group by course_id
					) as course_enrollment);
```

II.You will be working with the following schemas （Execute script files e2c.txt and e2i.txt.）: 

Employee (SSN, name, salary, DNo) 
Department (DNo, dept_name, mgr_SSN) 
Project (PNo, location, proj_name, DNo)
HourLog (SSN, PNo, hours) 
  
The Employee relation provides a list of employees with their SSN, name, salary, and department number (DNo). 
The SSN is unique for each employee. Each employee belongs to only one department. The Department relation 
contains a list of the departments for the company. Its schema includes a unique department number called DNo. 
It also includes the name of the department (dept_name) and the social security number of the department's 
manager (mgr_SSN). Each department has a only one manager. The Project relation includes a unique project 
number (PNo), location, the project name (proj_name) and the department(DNo) to be responsible for it. 
An employee can be assigned to any number (including zero) projects. Each project has at least one person 
assigned to it. Finally, the HourLog relation lists for each project the number of hours of work for each 
employee who is assigned to that project. The key of this relation is SSN and PNo. 

Write SQL statements to perform the following commands. 
1. List all managers’ SSN, name and salary. 
```sql
select ssn, name, salary
from employee;
```

2. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who works more than 100 hours on any project; make sure there are **no duplicates** in the result. 
```sql
select distinct name, ssn
from employee, hourlog
where employee.ssn = hourlog.ssn and hours > 100;
```

3. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who works on at least two projects. 
	先分组查询 找出ssn works at least two projects
	再联结employee
```sql
select distinct name, employee.ssn
from employee, hourlog
where employee.ssn in (select ssn 
					  from hourlog
					  group by ssn
					  having count(*)>= 2);
```

4. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who have never worked on any projects. 
	使用NOT
```sql
select distinct name, employee.ssn
from employee, hourlog
where not employee.ssn in (select ssn
						  from hourlog);
```

5. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who works on **all projects** that "Singh" (the name of an employee) works on. 集合包含题 必考 not exists...... ??????
```sql
select employee.name, employee.ssn
from employee, hourlog --join
where hourlog.ssn = employee.ssn
and hourlog.pno in (select pno --筛选出选择了至少一个Singh项目的人
			from hourlog, employee
			where hourlog.ssn = employee.ssn
			and name = 'Singh')
group by employee.name,employee.ssn  --筛选出数量和Singh相同的人
having count(distinct hourlog.pno) = (select count(pno)
									 from employee, hourlog 
									 where hourlog.ssn = employee.ssn
									 and name = 'Singh')
and employee.name != 'Singh';  --去除Singh本身
```

6. Find the name and the SSN of everyone who works on **all projects** that his deparment is responsible for them.
	联结三表
	筛选emloyee.dno = project.dno
	分组查询 判断employee项目数量是否等于department的项目数量

```sql
select employee.name, employee.ssn
from employee, project, hourlog, (select project.dno, count(pno) as p_count --求本部门的项目总数量
									 from project, employee
									 where project.dno = employee.dno group by project.dno) as p_num
where project.pno = hourlog.pno
and hourlog.ssn = employee.ssn
and employee.dno = project.dno --筛选employee负责的本部门的项目
and employee.dno = p_num.dno
group by employee.name, employee.ssn, p_num.p_count
having count(distinct project.pno) = p_num.p_count;  --筛选出负责项目数量=部门项目总数
```
