### Introduction to Data Protection and Security

#### Data-Security Environment
![[Pasted image 20240701084231.png|280]]


#### Developing a Data Protection Plan
###### Five Key Steps
Perform a Risk Assessment
Develop a Security Policy
Develop an Implementation Plan
Create a Security Organization
Perform a Security Audit


#### What is Good Data-Security?
###### Highest Degree of Security
- New technologies
- Organizational policies and procdures
- Industry standards and government laws

###### Other Factors
- Time values of money
- Cost of security v.s. potential loss
- Security often breaks at weakest link

###### The Tension
- Between Security and ==Ease of Use==
	The more security measures added are added to a e-business site, the more difficult a site is to use, and the slower it becomes.
- Between Security and ==Privacy==
	Desire of Individuals to Act Anonymously
	Use of technology by criminals to plan crimes or threaten nation-state

#### Dimensions of Data-Security

#### Electronic Transactions
###### Encryption
- Transforms plain text or data into cipher text
- Readable only by sender and receiver
- Secures stored information & information transmission
- Provides 4 of [[#Dimensions of Data-Security|6 key dimensions of e-security]]
	1. Message integrity
	2. Nonrepudiation
	3. Authentication
	4. Confidentiality


#### Encryption
###### Two Methods of Encryption
- symmetric key encryption
- public key encryption



#### Public Key Crytography - A Simple Case
###### simplest use of public key cryptography

#### Public Key Encryption
- Using Digital Signatures and Hash Digest
- Hash function
	Mathematical algorithm that produces fixed-length number called message or hash digest
- Hash digest of message sent to recipient along with message to verify integrity
- Hash digest and message encrypted with recipient’s public key
- Entire cipher text then encrypted with sender’s private key → Creating digital signature for
	Authentication and Nonrepudiation

###### Public Key Encryption with Digital Signatures

#### Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)
###### PKI
- Use of public key cryptography working with certificate authority, which is accepted by all parties
- Goal → Facilitate trusted electronic transactions
- Combination of software, encryption technologies
- Widely used in e-commerce

###### PKI Components
- Key Pairs
- Certificate Authority
- Public Key Cryptography

###### Certification Authority (CA)


###### Digital Certificate




#### Ensuring Non-repudiation


#### Incorporating XML and PKI



#### Fraud in Electronic Transactions



#### SSL Session
