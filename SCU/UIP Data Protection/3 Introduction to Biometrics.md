#### History


#### Biometric Characteristics
##### Measurements
- physiological
- behavioral

##### Desired Properties
- universality
- distinctiveness
- permanence
- collectability
- performance
- users acceptability
- robustness against circumvention

#### Biometric Systems
- biometric acquisition
- feature extraction
- matching against the template in database
- decision

##### Operating Modes
- verification mode
	positive recognition (prevent multiple people from using same identity)
- identification mode
	negative recognition

#### Biometrics System Errors
##### Variation in biometric characteristics
- imperfect imaging conditions
- changes in physiological/behavioral characteristics
- users interaction with sensor


##### False Match, False Accept
mistaking biometric measurements from two different persons

##### False Non-Match, False Reject
mistaking biometric measurements from same person



##### Errors in Identification
- test samples
- training samples
- recognition accracy
- confusion matrix


#### DNA
##### problems
- privacy issues
- easy to steal
- real time recognition
- impossible to distinguish identical twins


#### Ear
##### problems
- ear features are not expected to be very distinctive
- hair, may be solved


#### Thermogrem
##### problems
- presence of heat emitting surfaces in vicnity of body
- required infrared sensores, cost increase


#### Fingerprint
##### problems
- fingerprints of small fraction of population may not be suitable
- large compution, user acceptance


#### Gait
##### problems
- may not remain invariant
- not very distinctive
- can be obscured or disguised
- intensive input, computationally intensive


#### Face
##### problems
- surveillance
- dynamic, uncontrolled face identification in cluttered background
- identical twins

#### Keystroke
##### problems
- performance
- some individual
- biased
- requires substantial samples of text, not just a sentence


#### Odor
##### problems
- invariance in body odor in presence of surrounding environment
- still being investigated by researchers

#### Voice
##### problems
- speech features
- varying claims on performance
- lack of independent large scale trials
- not very distinctive


#### Retinal Scan
##### problems
- acquisition
- lower user acceptance
- retinal vascular


#### Iris
##### problems
- user participation
- user acceptance
- iridology

#### Hand Geometry
##### problems
- systems
- problems due to Jewelary, growth period of children
- spoofing


#### Vein
##### problems
- IR imaging


#### Signature
##### problems
- behavioural biometric
- signatures of some people very substantially
- mechanics of signing are not invarient over time
- professional forgers, skilled foryery (inherent part of system evaluation)

#### Other Biometrics
- otoacoustic emissions
- skin spectrum
- lips movement/shape
- nailbed
- knuckled creases articulations
- reflection of acoustic waves in the head
- skin impedance
- hand pressure profile


#### Behavioural Biometrics



#### Deployment Challenges
